Impact summary: A stack buffer overflow may lead to a crash, causing Denial of Service, or potentially remote code execution.  When parsing CMS (Auth)EnvelopedData structures that use AEAD ciphers such as AES-GCM, the IV (Initialization Vector) encoded in the ASN.1 parameters is copied into a fixed-size stack buffer without verifying that its length fits the destination. An attacker can supply a crafted CMS message with an oversized IV, causing a stack-based out-of-bounds write before any authentication or tag verification occurs.  Applications and services that parse untrusted CMS or PKCS#7 content using AEAD ciphers (e.g., S/MIME (Auth)EnvelopedData with AES-GCM) are vulnerable. Because the overflow occurs prior to authentication, no valid key material is required to trigger it. While exploitability to remote code execution depends on platform and toolchain mitigations, the stack-based write primitive represents a severe risk.

The severity has been reduced accordingly.\n\nDetails\n\nThe arrayLimit option only checked limits for indexed notation (a[0]=1&a[1]=2) but did not enforce it for bracket notation (a[]=1&a[]=2).\n\nVulnerable code (lib/parse.js:159-162):\n\nif (root === '[]' && options.parseArrays) {\n    obj = utils.combine([], leaf);  // No arrayLimit check\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking code (lib/parse.js:175):\n\nelse if (index <= options.arrayLimit) {  // Limit checked here\n    obj = [];\n    obj[index] = leaf;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bracket notation handler at line 159 uses utils.combine([], leaf) without validating against options.arrayLimit, while indexed notation at line 175 checks index <= options.arrayLimit before creating arrays.\n\n\n\nPoC\n\nconst qs = require('qs');\nconst result = qs.parse('a[]=1&a[]=2&a[]=3&a[]=4&a[]=5&a[]=6', { arrayLimit: 5 });\nconsole.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 6 (should be max 5)\n\n\n\n\n\nNote on parameterLimit interaction: The original advisory's \"DoS demonstration\" claimed a length of 10,000, but parameterLimit (default: 1000) caps parsing to 1,000 parameters. With default options, the actual output is 1,000, not 10,000.\n\nImpact\n\nConsistency bug in arrayLimit enforcement. With default parameterLimit, the practical DoS risk is negligible since parameterLimit already caps the total number of parsed parameters (and thus array elements from bracket notation). The risk increases only when parameterLimit is explicitly set to a very high value.","cvss":[{"source":"7ffcee3d-2c14-4c3e-b844-86c6a321a158","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:L/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":6.3},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"7ffcee3d-2c14-4c3e-b844-86c6a321a158","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":3.7,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-15284","epss":0.00224,"percentile":0.44852,"date":"2026-02-28"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-15284","cwe":"CWE-20","source":"7ffcee3d-2c14-4c3e-b844-86c6a321a158","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"qs","version":"6.13.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p","versionConstraint":"<6.14.1 (semantic)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.14.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"f1485a5d8cce1397","name":"qs","version":"6.13.0","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/juice-shop/node_modules/qs/package.json","layerID":"sha256:b9d23411f142a4775d254fcb247412dba31307c736d33ad7938b1c11cce3e077","accessPath":"/juice-shop/node_modules/qs/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:qs_project:qs:6.13.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/qs@6.13.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-grv7-fg5c-xmjg","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-grv7-fg5c-xmjg","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-4068","https://github.com/micromatch/braces/issues/35","https://devhub.checkmarx.com/cve-details/CVE-2024-4068","https://github.com/micromatch/braces/blob/98414f9f1fabe021736e26836d8306d5de747e0d/lib/parse.js#L308","https://github.com/micromatch/braces/pull/37","https://github.com/micromatch/braces/pull/40","https://github.com/micromatch/braces/commit/415d660c3002d1ab7e63dbf490c9851da80596ff"],"description":"Uncontrolled resource consumption in braces","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4068","epss":0.00225,"percentile":0.44921,"date":"2026-02-28"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4068","cwe":"CWE-1050","source":"596c5446-0ce5-4ba2-aa66-48b3b757a647","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-4068","cwe":"CWE-400","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.0.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"3.0.3","date":"2026-02-12","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.16874999999999998},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-4068","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-4068","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://devhub.checkmarx.com/cve-details/CVE-2024-4068/","https://github.com/micromatch/braces/commit/415d660c3002d1ab7e63dbf490c9851da80596ff","https://github.com/micromatch/braces/issues/35","https://github.com/micromatch/braces/pull/37","https://github.com/micromatch/braces/pull/40"],"description":"The NPM package `braces`, versions prior to 3.0.3, fails to limit the number of characters it can handle, which could lead to Memory Exhaustion.

The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persists.

Impact summary: A NULL pointer dereference can trigger a crash which leads to Denial of Service for an application processing PKCS#12 files.  The PKCS12_item_decrypt_d2i_ex() function does not check whether the oct parameter is NULL before dereferencing it. When called from PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata() with a malformed PKCS#12 file, this parameter can be NULL, causing a crash. The vulnerability is limited to Denial of Service and cannot be escalated to achieve code execution or memory disclosure.  Exploiting this issue requires an attacker to provide a malformed PKCS#12 file to an application that processes it.

Impact summary: The out-of-bounds write can cause a memory corruption which can have various consequences including a Denial of Service.  The OPENSSL_uni2utf8() function performs a two-pass conversion of a PKCS#12 BMPString (UTF-16BE) to UTF-8.

summary: A type confusion vulnerability exists in the signature verification of signed PKCS#7 data where an ASN1_TYPE union member is accessed without first validating the type, causing an invalid or NULL pointer dereference when processing malformed PKCS#7 data.  Impact summary: An application performing signature verification of PKCS#7 data or calling directly the PKCS7_digest_from_attributes() function can be caused to dereference an invalid or NULL pointer when reading, resulting in a Denial of Service.  The function PKCS7_digest_from_attributes() accesses the message digest attribute value without validating its type. When the type is not V_ASN1_OCTET_STRING, this results in accessing invalid memory through the ASN1_TYPE union, causing a crash.  Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to provide a malformed signed PKCS#7 to an application that verifies it. The impact of the exploit is just a Denial of Service, the PKCS7 API is legacy and applications should be using the CMS API instead. For these reasons the issue was assessed as Low severity.  The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue, as the PKCS#7 parsing implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.

Summary\nThe `arrayLimit` option in qs does not enforce limits for comma-separated values when `comma: true` is enabled, allowing attackers to cause denial-of-service via memory exhaustion. This is a bypass of the array limit enforcement, similar to the bracket notation bypass addressed in GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p (CVE-2025-15284).\n\n### Details\nWhen the `comma` option is set to `true` (not the default, but configurable in applications), qs allows parsing comma-separated strings as arrays (e.g., `?param=a,b,c` becomes `['a', 'b', 'c']`). However, the limit check for `arrayLimit` (default: 20) and the optional throwOnLimitExceeded occur after the comma-handling logic in `parseArrayValue`, enabling a bypass. This permits creation of arbitrarily large arrays from a single parameter, leading to excessive memory allocation.\n\n**Vulnerable code** (lib/parse.js: lines ~40-50):\n```js\nif (val && typeof val === 'string' && options.comma && val.indexOf(',') > -1) {\n    return val.split(',');\n}\n\nif (options.throwOnLimitExceeded && currentArrayLength >= options.arrayLimit) {\n    throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.');\n}\n\nreturn val;\n```\nThe `split(',')` returns the array immediately, skipping the subsequent limit check. Downstream merging via `utils.combine` does not prevent allocation, even if it marks overflows for sparse arrays.This discrepancy allows attackers to send a single parameter with millions of commas (e.g., `?param=,,,,,,,,...`), allocating massive arrays in memory without triggering limits. It bypasses the intent of `arrayLimit`, which is enforced correctly for indexed (`a[0]=`) and bracket (`a[]=`) notations (the latter fixed in v6.14.1 per GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p).\n\n### PoC\n**Test 1 - Basic bypass:**\n```\nnpm install qs\n```\n\n```js\nconst qs = require('qs');\n\nconst payload = 'a=' + ','.repeat(25);  // 26 elements after split (bypasses arrayLimit: 5)\nconst options = { comma: true, arrayLimit: 5, throwOnLimitExceeded: true };\n\ntry {\n  const result = qs.parse(payload, options);\n  console.log(result.a.length);  // Outputs: 26 (bypass successful)\n} catch (e) {\n  console.log('Limit enforced:', e.message);  // Not thrown\n}\n```\n**Configuration:**\n- `comma: true`\n- `arrayLimit: 5`\n- `throwOnLimitExceeded: true`\n\nExpected: Throws \"Array limit exceeded\" error.\nActual: Parses successfully, creating an array of length 26.\n\n\n### Impact\nDenial of Service (DoS) via memory exhaustion.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"7ffcee3d-2c14-4c3e-b844-86c6a321a158","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":6.3},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"7ffcee3d-2c14-4c3e-b844-86c6a321a158","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":3.7,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2026-2391","epss":0.00039,"percentile":0.11779,"date":"2026-02-28"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2026-2391","cwe":"CWE-20","source":"7ffcee3d-2c14-4c3e-b844-86c6a321a158","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"qs","version":"6.13.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-w7fw-mjwx-w883","versionConstraint":">=6.7.0,<=6.14.1 (semantic)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.14.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"f1485a5d8cce1397","name":"qs","version":"6.13.0","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/juice-shop/node_modules/qs/package.json","layerID":"sha256:b9d23411f142a4775d254fcb247412dba31307c736d33ad7938b1c11cce3e077","accessPath":"/juice-shop/node_modules/qs/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:qs_project:qs:6.13.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/qs@6.13.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-9232","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-9232","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Issue summary: An application using the OpenSSL HTTP client API functions may trigger an out-of-bounds read if the 'no_proxy' environment variable is set and the host portion of the authority component of the HTTP URL is an IPv6 address.

Users can protect against this kind of attack on the server by using `node --disable-proto=delete` or `deno` (in Deno, pollution protection is on by default).","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-64718","epss":0.0002,"percentile":0.04941,"date":"2026-02-28"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-64718","cwe":"CWE-1321","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"js-yaml","version":"3.14.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-mh29-5h37-fv8m","versionConstraint":"<3.14.2 (semantic)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.14.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"2ec6fdae7536262a","name":"js-yaml","version":"3.14.1","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/juice-shop/node_modules/js-yaml/package.json","layerID":"sha256:b9d23411f142a4775d254fcb247412dba31307c736d33ad7938b1c11cce3e077","accessPath":"/juice-shop/node_modules/js-yaml/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodeca:js-yaml:3.14.1:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/js-yaml@3.14.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-55130","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-55130","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/december-2025-security-releases"],"description":"A flaw in Node.js’s Permissions model allows attackers to bypass `--allow-fs-read` and `--allow-fs-write` restrictions using crafted relative symlink paths.

Impact summary: An application processing a malformed PKCS#12 file can be caused to dereference an invalid or NULL pointer on memory read, resulting in a Denial of Service.  A type confusion vulnerability exists in PKCS#12 parsing code where an ASN1_TYPE union member is accessed without first validating the type, causing an invalid pointer read.  The location is constrained to a 1-byte address space, meaning any attempted pointer manipulation can only target addresses between 0x00 and 0xFF.

Prior to versions 8.0.3, 5.2.2, 4.0.4, and 3.5.1, attempting to parse a patch whose filename headers contain the line break characters `\\r`, `\\u2028`, or `\\u2029` can cause the `parsePatch` method to enter an infinite loop. It then consumes memory without limit until the process crashes due to running out of memory. Applications are therefore likely to be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack if they call `parsePatch` with a user-provided patch as input. A large payload is not needed to trigger the vulnerability, so size limits on user input do not provide any protection. Furthermore, some applications may be vulnerable even when calling `parsePatch` on a patch generated by the application itself if the user is nonetheless able to control the filename headers (e.g. by directly providing the filenames of the files to be diffed). The `applyPatch` method is similarly affected if (and only if) called with a string representation of a patch as an argument, since under the hood it parses that string using `parsePatch`. Other methods of the library are unaffected. Finally, a second and lesser interdependent bug - a ReDOS - also exhibits when those same line break characters are present in a patch's *patch* header (also known as its \"leading garbage\"). A maliciously-crafted patch header of length *n* can take `parsePatch` O(*n*³) time to parse. Versions 8.0.3, 5.2.2, 4.0.4, and 3.5.1 contain a fix. As a workaround, do not attempt to parse patches that contain any of these characters: `\\r`, `\\u2028`, or `\\u2029`.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":2.7},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2026-24001","epss":0.0002,"percentile":0.04859,"date":"2026-02-28"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2026-24001","cwe":"CWE-400","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2026-24001","cwe":"CWE-1333","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"diff","version":"4.0.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-73rr-hh4g-fpgx","versionConstraint":">=4.0.0,<4.0.4 (semantic)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"4.0.4"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a4cf03c6615f9d2d","name":"diff","version":"4.0.2","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/juice-shop/node_modules/ts-node-dev/node_modules/diff/package.json","layerID":"sha256:b9d23411f142a4775d254fcb247412dba31307c736d33ad7938b1c11cce3e077","accessPath":"/juice-shop/node_modules/ts-node-dev/node_modules/diff/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:kpdecker:diff:4.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:diff:diff:4.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/diff@4.0.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-8qq5-rm4j-mr97","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8qq5-rm4j-mr97","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-8qq5-rm4j-mr97","https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/commit/340eb285b6d986e91969a1170d7fe9b0face405e","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23745"],"description":"node-tar is Vulnerable to Arbitrary File Overwrite and Symlink Poisoning via Insufficient Path Sanitization","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:L/VA:N/SC:H/SI:L/SA:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2026-23745","epss":0.00007,"percentile":0.00582,"date":"2026-02-28"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2026-23745","cwe":"CWE-22","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["7.5.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"7.5.3","date":"2026-02-12","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.005494999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2026-23745","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23745","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/commit/340eb285b6d986e91969a1170d7fe9b0face405e","https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-8qq5-rm4j-mr97"],"description":"node-tar is a Tar for Node.js.
